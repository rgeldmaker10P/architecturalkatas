# Description

We're Taking Requests...
A local radio station wants to connect DJs more closely to their audience, so audience members can request songs, vote on songs playing right now, vote on the DJ's daily play list, and so on

Users: unsure; whatever the local "music" community is

Requirements: near-real-time synced with the music on the air; user voting mechanism; mobile-device accessibility
